# SubScript lang to write substrate based smart contract

SubScript is a smart contract language written in AssemblyScript for substrate based chain. We will provide essential substrate api and builtin tools to support contract development.

Similar to parity ink, SubScript is built on top of  AssemblyScript and follow all AssemblyScript syntax. SubScript is more like a development kit with some builtin module and tools. As assemblyscript is easy to interact with TypeScript and JavaScript, SubScript is much more friendly for dapp developers.

## How SubScript Works

* Substrate's [Framework for Runtime Aggregation of Modularised Entities (FRAME)](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/next/conceptual/runtime/frame) contains the `contracts` pallet,
which implements an API for typical functions smart contracts need (storage, querying information about account, â€¦).
* The `contracts` pallet requires smart contracts to be uploaded to the blockchain as a Wasm blob.
* ink! is a smart contract language which targets the API exposed by `contracts`.
Hence ink! smart contracts are compiled to Wasm.
